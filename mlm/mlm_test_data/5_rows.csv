for performing the method according to the invention , there are provided a fiber removing apparatus , a quantity measuring apparatus and a control apparatus which controls the mode of operation of the fiber removing apparatus .
the fiber removing apparatus as well as the quantity measuring apparatus may be of any selected type .
turning now to fig1 and 2 , in a preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention , a series of textile fiber bales 1a , 1b and 1c are arranged side - by - side on a bale support , under which travels a carriage 3 on which there are mounted two spiked fiber bale opener aprons 4 , 5 , constituting a fiber removing apparatus 2 . on the carriage 3 there is laterally mounted a height - measuring device 6 which constitutes a fiber quantity measuring apparatus and which is , in essence , a light barrier formed of a light transmitter 7 and a light receiver 8 . the upper ends of the light barrier project upwardly beyond the maximum expected height of the fiber bales .
the receiver 8 of the height - measuring device 6 is connected , by the intermediary of a computer 9 , with an input of a control device 10 coupled to a timer 11 . an output of the control device 10 is connected with a drive motor 12 of the carriage 3 . at one end , the carriage 3 has a switching element 13 which consecutively engages contacts 14a , 14b and 14c , laterally mounted on the machine frame at bales 1a , 1b and 1c , respectively .
the switching element 13 is coupled with an input of the control device 10 so that as the bale opener 2 reaches its starting position , a signal is applied to the control device 10 . the signal starts the measuring process , the displacement of the carriage 3 as well as the rotation of the breaker aprons 4 and 5 . the switching contacts 14a , 14b and 14c may also be utilized for reversing the drive of the carriage 3 in case the determined partial quantity is removed from the bales continuously by several back - and - forth passes .
